I have moved through different dataset sources to come up with the right dataset for my project.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">The second problem was cleaning up the dataset I got. The data has some pictures and texts on the first some rows of the data so, I have to cut and clean up them before loading to power BI desktop.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Selecting the right KPI for the project was the other challenge. I have googled and went through previous projects to come up with the right KPIâ€™s for the project.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">The other challenge was I could not get the intended results from the data set, even if I created Calendar table and connected it with the dataset table on invoice date column. The cause of the problem was the data type of the Calendar table Date and the Invoice date was different. After I changed the data type of the Invoice Date into Date data type that solves the problem and I manage to get the intended results to display in the visuals.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1190/3/2.jpg" style="width: 1291.4px; height: 1098.73px;"><br></p>
